1. INTRODUCTION
Lane detection is a key task in the development of intelligent transport systems, aiding in navigation and safety. The project employs the Hough Transform, a robust method for detecting linear features, to identify road lane markings in various conditions. MATLAB was chosen for its strong image processing toolbox and simplicity in prototyping algorithms.
1.1 PROJECT OBJECTIVES
The primary aim of this project is to develop an efficient lane detection system using the Hough Transform implemented in MATLAB. This system identifies and marks lane boundaries in road images and videos, providing a foundational tool for autonomous driving systems and advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS).
